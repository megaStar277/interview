State is considered to be dynamic, meaning that it can change over time as a result of user interactions or other events.On the other hand, Props are considered to be static and cannot be changed by the child component.Instead, the parent component is responsible for updating the value of its Props and passing the updated value to the child component.

A controlled component is one where the form data is managed by the component's state.

This approach allows for more control over the data and makes it easier to implement features like validation.

An uncontrolled component, on the other hand, manages its form data using the DOM.You access the input's value through a ref, which allows the input to maintain its own state. This can be simpler to set up for basic forms where you don't need to manage the data actively within the component.

        Virtual DOM is about avoiding unnecessary changes to the DOM, which are expensive performance-wise, because changes to the DOM usually cause re-rendering of the page. Virtual DOM also allows to collect several changes to be applied at once, so not every single change causes a re-render, but instead re-rendering only happens once after a set of changes was applied to the DOM.
        - Shadow DOM,
        
        Shadow dom is mostly about encapsulation of the implementation. A single custom element can implement more-or-less complex logic combined with more-or-less complex DOM. An entire web application of arbitrary complexity can be added to a page by an import and <body><my-app></my-app> but also simpler reusable and composable components can be implemented as custom elements where the internal representation is hidden in the shadow DOM like <date-picker></date-picker>.`

Check out this Full stack developer course online to learn more about react.

This Virtual DOM works in three simple steps.

Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.
Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.
Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed. `

        - Lack of data integrity: Model data can be mutated from anywhere, yielding unpredictable results across the UI.
        With the Flux pattern complex UIs no longer suffer from cascading updates; any given React component will be able to reconstruct its state based on the data provided by the store. The Flux pattern also enforces data integrity by restricting direct access to the shared data.

        In the lifecycle of a component, React re-renders the component when an update is made.

This change in the React application will cause it to re-render unnecessarily.
        Additionally, if that re-rendering is an expensive operation, like a long for loop, it can hurt performance. Expensive operations can be costly in either time, memory, or processing.
        When:
        
        Optimal if the wrapped function is large and expensive.
        How:
        
        Memoization is an optimization technique which passes a complex function to be memoized. In memoization, the result is “remembered” when the same parameters are passed-in subsequently.
        useMemo takes in a function and an array of dependencies. The dependency’s list are the elements useMemo watches: if there are no changes, the function result will stay the same. Otherwise, it will re-run the function. If they don’t change, it doesn’t matter if our entire component re-renders, the function won’t re-run but instead return the stored result.`

        content: `- useEffect - It's the alternative for the class component lifecycle methods componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, componentDidUpdate, etc. I can also use it to create a side effect when dependencies change, i.e. "If some variable changes, do this".
        - useCallback - On every render, everything that's inside a functional component will run again. If a child component has a dependency on a function from the parent component, the child will re-render every time the parent re-renders even if that function "doesn't change" (the reference changes, but what the function does won't).
        It's used for optimization by avoiding unnecessary renders from the child, making the function change the reference only when dependencies change. I should use it when a function is a dependency of a side effect e.g. useEffect.
        - useMemo - It will run on every render, but with cached values. It will only use new values when certain dependencies change. It's used for optimization when I have expensive computations.`

        This approach significantly reduces memory allocation and GC thrashing for incremental updates to the DOM tree therefore increasing performance significantly in some cases.
        - Virtual DOM compares (diff) a new entire virtual DOM with the previous virtual DOM for changes then applies those changes to the actual DOM. - This approach creates a new virtual DOM to determine the changes (memory heavy). Has a big memory footprint because it needs headroom for changes that "might" happen to the virtual DOM.`

        An example will be a list of items, where I need to add, update and remove items in the state, Here I might have noticed that the state management logic takes a good part of the component body. useReducer helps to separate the concerns of rendering vs a concern of state management.
        useReducer also lets I optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because I can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks. React guarantees that dispatch function identity is stable and won’t change on re-renders. This is why it’s safe to omit from the useEffect or useCallback dependency list.`

        While there are many other considerations when comparing React and Angular specifically, this key architectural difference means that:
        - Using a library such as React can give a project a greater ability to evolve parts of the system—again for example, state management—over time, when new solutions are created by the open source community.

        4. Portals : Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

        There are a few downsides to using hooks to return JSX
        - When I write a hook that returns JSX component, I are essentially defining the component within the functional component, so on each and every re-render I will be creating a new instance of the component. This will lead to the component being unmounted and mounted again. This is bad for performance and also buggy if I have stateful login within the component as the state will get reset with every re-render of the parent
        - By defining a JSX component within the hook, I are taking away the option of lazy loading my component if the need be.
        - Any performance optimization to the component will require I to make use of useMemo which doesn't give I the flexibility of a custom comparator function like React.memo()
        The benefit on the other hand is that I have control over the state of the component in the parent. However, I can still implement the same logic by using a controlled component approach`
