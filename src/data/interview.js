    content: `One of the most impressive projects I worked on involved natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create a search site. The site utilized NLP to extract relevant files and responses from a large database based on user input in natural language. Similar to Google, this site was able to search through various types of data including news, scientific and technical information, and more. 

To process the data, Elasticsearch was used for its powerful querying capabilities. When a user entered a search term, an Elasticsearch query was generated using OpenAI's technology. The query was then pre-processed and passed on to the search engine.
I used node.js for the backend and React for the frontend.
Most of what I was responsible for in this project was frontend, REST api and admin dashboard.
As for a development on my side, I have used React, material UI, Tailwind CSS, Axios for the REST api, react-saga for redux.

Another interesting project I worked on was a chatbot that utilized ML. Two key features of this chatbot were its learning function and field selection. To train the chatbot, learning materials were manually prepared and the chatbot was trained for a week. During this time, the field was set as healthcare and appropriate information was selected and learned. As a result, customer service work was reduced by over 20%.

I gave importance to the code optimization, responsiveness and the render speed.
The most exciting thing was that I used some of react hook functions in this project such as useMemo, useCallback so that I can reduce unnecessary rendering into components.
As a result, my customers gave me good feedbacks and reviews.

        Task : I felt it was my responsibility to come up with a solution to get the issues fixed. I stayed behind late that evening collaborating with other experienced team
        members to come up with a plan that would ensure the bugs were not only full rectified, but that a support system was in place to respond to any future issues if they were to arise, post handover.
        Action : We started off by creating a list of all bugs and issues. We then attempted to recreate each bug so that we could assess what was causing the issue.
        We managed to recreate all of the bugs and it was then my task to create a timescale for rectifying and testing each issue.
        Once we had a plan in place, we could then allocate tasks to team members based on their area of technical competence the follwing morning.

        This is also very interesting, but I have made up my mind that if I want to do something big that I can contribute not only for myself but also for society, I have to work for a full-time job like yours.
        Even if it's not a career that I'm proud of, I think it's an experience of going through hardships that must have as an engineer.

        I replied that this problem was not included at the time of the contract and that I didn't like to increase the amount of work in this way.
        He said that I was right, and then let's go ahead as planned.
        Then, even though I had achieved my goal, I was not happy at all.
        So I apologized to the customer and updated the site with a new design I made, and the project was guaranteed in time. He expressed great satisfaction.
        I think I forgot for a while that the customer was my god at that time.
        Since then, when working with customers, I do a lot of research and raise enough possible problems so that customers don't miss anything.
