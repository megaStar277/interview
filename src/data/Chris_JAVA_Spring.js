        I created a versatile search tool that helps people find hospital information and analytics for over 3,000 hospitals nationwide.
         Using React, Django, and Elasticsearch, I built a user-friendly platform that includes features like hospital mapping and detailed statistics. 
         I'm particularly proud of optimizing the site's performance using advanced React techniques, which resulted in faster loading times and a smoother user experience. 
         The project was a huge success, earning great feedback from customers and potentially saving the healthcare system up to 500,000 dollars by improving efficiency and access to information.
         This experience taught me the value of combining technical skills with real-world problem-solving to create meaningful solutions in healthcare`

        content: `First of all, let me tell you about myself.
I am a backend Java developer with 10 years of experience. I specialize in microservices and RESTful API development, and in addition to backend development, I am interested in cloud technologies, DevOps practices, and database management.
My great performances are in Java 17+, Spring Boot, Spring Data, and MongoDB. I also have strong knowledge in designing and implementing RESTful APIs, which always helps me build robust and scalable applications.
My software developer career started when I was a university student. When I was a sophomore, I really loved algorithms and later enterprise application development, so I was selected as one of the Java development team members and participated in various projects.
In the team, I learned and practiced modern microservices architectures and design patterns. That was my meaningful start in the world of enterprise software development.
Later, my skills expanded amazingly, especially in Spring Boot and cloud technologies. I built over 30 microservices using this stack in the past 5 years, deploying them on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes.
I have comprehensive experience with the entire development-release lifecycle, including CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. My problem-solving skills and ability to translate functional requirements into technical solutions have been honed through working in cross-functional teams on complex projects.
I am self-motivated and always eager to learn new technologies and business domains. My experience spans various industries, including healthcare and finance, giving me insight into developing software for regulated sectors.
Actually, I am available now and can start a new role immediately.
That's all.`
