        - Increase my income. Trying to balance life and business and increase income for a better future life. I will increase my income to over $12,000 per month on average.
        - Improve relationships with team members. I try to possess leadership skills in the process of cooperation with different team members.
        - Have a new experience. As an important core engineer of the technical team, I will have more experience in interpersonal relationships and in the technology stack.`

        I find that routine can make us complacent, so I try to look for challenges that push me to grow. 
        One time, I was supposed to deliver a project to a client in five days. 
        A colleague who was working with another client had the same deadline, but he had to take a leave of absence due to personal reasons.
         I was asked to take up both projects at the same time.
          While I felt an initial sense of panic, I came up with a very detailed time management plan and

        This provides data, statistics, and analytics about more than 3,000 hospitals nationwide. 
        Elasticsearch was used as a search engine for data processing.
        I used Django python framework for the backend and React for the frontend.
        Most of what I was responsible for in this project was frontend, REST api and admin dashboard.
        As for a development on my side, I have used React, material UI, Tailwind CSS, Axios for the REST api, react-saga for redux.
        This site consists of a landing page, a research component, a category page for displaying the hospital list, and a reservation page.
        I gave importance to the code optimization, responsiveness and the render speed.
        The most exciting thing was that I used some of react hook functions in this project such as useMemo, useCallback so that I can reduce unnecessary rendering into components.
        As a result, my customers gave me good feedbacks and reviews.
