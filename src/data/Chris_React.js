        I created a versatile search tool that helps people find hospital information and analytics for over 3,000 hospitals nationwide.
         Using React, Django, and Elasticsearch, I built a user-friendly platform that includes features like hospital mapping and detailed statistics. 
         I'm particularly proud of optimizing the site's performance using advanced React techniques, which resulted in faster loading times and a smoother user experience. 
         The project was a huge success, earning great feedback from customers and potentially saving the healthcare system up to 500,000 dollars by improving efficiency and access to information.
         This experience taught me the value of combining technical skills with real-world problem-solving to create meaningful solutions in healthcare`

        content: `First of all, let me tell you about myself.
        I am a front-end JavaScript developer with 10 years of experience.       
       I specialize in Web and Decentralized applications, and in addition to front-end development, I am interested in Web Design, back-end development and GraphQL.       
        My great performances are in TypeScript, JavaScript and its libraries such as React, Redux, Web3.js, etc.       
       I also have strong knowledge in Data Structure & Algorithm, which always helps me build robust applications.
       My software developer career was started when I was a university student at the Hong Kong College of Technology.
       When I was a sophomore, I really loved maths, and later programming so I was selected as one of the Programing contest candidates and participated in a training team.
       In the team, I learned and practised modern data structrues and algorithmic patterns.
       That was my meaningful start in the software developers’ world.
       Later my skills expanded amazingly, especially in React. I built over 30 websites using this stack in 2018.
       Actually, I am free now and I can start a new work immediately.
       That's all.`
